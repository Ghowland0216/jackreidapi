I read _The History of the Bible_ this weekend and enjoyed it a lot. I have a little collection of books about theology now, not because of any interest in faith but because I think it's an interesting vein of history and culture. The bible is so often quoted, wittingly or unwittingly, in popular culture and everyday speech. Here are some good excerpts from the book.

> The climax of the book is an appearance by God (not unlike the _deus ex machina_ in a Greek tragedy), in which God sarcastically tells Job that he knows nothing, since he is so puny compared to the power of the creator:
> > Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?
> > Tell me if you have understanding.
> > Who determined its measurements - surely you know?
> > Or who stretched the line upon it?
> > On what were its bases sunk,
> > Or who laid its cornerstone
> > when the morning stars sang together
> > and all the heavenly being shouted joy?
> > 
> — Job 38:4-7

> When Paul says that a greeting at the end of one of his letters in written in his own hand:
> > See what large letters I make make when I am writing in my own hand!
> > 
> — Galatians 6:11

> Paul also seems to see Jesus as lower in status than God himself:
> > Christ is the head of every man, and the husband is the head of his wife, and God is the head of Christ.
> — 1 Corinthians 15:28
> 
> The New testament thus supports at most a subordinationist Christology, that is, one in which Jesus as the Son is of lower status than God The Father.
