I wanted to quickly follow up to my recent post about personal infrastructure with some updates I made this week.

## Why the change
I got a warning last week that I was almost at the limit for my allocation of "build minutes" on Netlify. Upon investigation, I found that my personal website had been building too often and for too long on Netlify, and that soon they would start charging me for the overages. Looking at the logs and running the build locally I saw that the vast majority of the build time was down to preprocessing the many images in the "Photo" part of my site to compress and resize them. So, in the short term those have been removed; I wasn't really presenting them very well anyway.

Either way, this warning along with a vague irritation that I'm paying $9 a month made me want to look into how I could get off the freemium service. Netlify is great, don't get me wrong, but this was also a chance for me to try out some new problems for myself. After all, I'm paying $10 a month for a DigitalOcean VPS and the same again for a Postgres instance.

## Requirements
