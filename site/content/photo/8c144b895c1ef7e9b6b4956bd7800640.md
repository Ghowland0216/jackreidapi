  The Man From Platform 10 ðŸšˆOn the day the storm basically shut down transport in the South East, this guy was on a mission to make sure everybody got home okay. I see him all the time, marshalling conflicting information and reassuring worried and tired commuters. Dude's turned whatever his job is into a vocation. Have to respect that.#vsco #vscofilm #stratford #portrait #candid #streetphotography #london
