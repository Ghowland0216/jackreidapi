Hi, I'm Jack Reid. I'm a software engineer for BuzzFeed, living in South London.

At BuzzFeed I work on building websites, with a special focus on accessibility. Outside of BuzzFeed my personality is unfortunately a thin layer over the last few things I've read, listened to, or watched. For that reason most of this website is a catalog of the media I've consumed and enjoyed.

I track the [films](/films/watched) I've watched and the [books](/books/read) I've read, but I also post [highlight](/highlights) from articles I read online. You can even see what I've got [saved](/articles/saved) to read later in Pocket.

For some rare pieces of original thought, there's my [notes](/note) (think tweets) and [posts](/post).
